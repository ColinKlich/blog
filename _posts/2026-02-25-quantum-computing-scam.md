## The Reality Check

This morning, I thought Quantum Computing was the future. I've heard consistently that Quantum Computing will change the game, solve Cancer, crack the hardest encryptions, and generally make traditional computing (with 1s and 0s) obsolete.

Until I watched a video that challenged everything I thought I knew.

Now, I'm not so sure.

## The Fundamental Problem

The main issue with quantum computing lies in the nature of the **qubit** — the fundamental unit of quantum information. Unlike classical bits that exist in a state of 0 or 1, qubits can hold both states simultaneously in a phenomenon known as **superposition**.

But here's the catch: when qubits are observed, they collapse to a single state, and you only get a *probability* of each state — not an exact value like a traditional computer. This means:

- Each observation gives different probabilities
- On a large scale, measurements can vary drastically
- **Consistency is impossible**

### Environmental Control Requirements

The problem gets worse. Most quantum computers require temperatures well below outer space just to function properly. Traditional computing, by contrast, requires minimal environmental control and still provides nearly perfect computation every single time due to the binary nature of bits.

This level of consistency isn't a luxury — it's a **fundamental requirement** for operating systems, apps, and services like Gmail and Word to function.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

**Quantum Computers will likely NEVER be able to run a traditional operating system or consumer applications.**

So what can they do? Maybe crack RSA encryption... but even that's questionable.

## Shor's Algorithm: The One Use Case

Back in the 1990s, Peter Shor demonstrated a theoretical algorithm for cracking RSA encryption using quantum computing. The algorithm is incredibly complicated, but it does show exponential improvement over traditional encryption-cracking methods.

This discovery brought significant attention to quantum computing and may have sparked the idea that a major breakthrough was "just around the corner"—a corner we've been turning for almost 3 decades.

### The Drawbacks Are Staggering

A 2021 paper titled *"How to factor 2048 bit RSA integers in 8 hours using 20 million noisy qubits"* revealed a sobering reality:

- **20 million qubits** would be required to implement Shor's algorithm
- IBM's most powerful quantum computer has approximately **1,100 qubits**
- We're still **multiple orders of magnitude** away from what's needed

### The Encryption Will Evolve

Even if we somehow achieved the necessary qubit count, governments have already taken steps to improve or replace RSA encryption. By the time a functioning quantum computer could crack RSA, the encryption standard will be obsolete, replaced by far more sophisticated algorithms.

## The Hype Machine

Despite these devastating drawbacks, hundreds of millions of dollars are still being pumped into the quantum computing industry year after year. Companies produce little to no tangible results, yet continue to burn through investor capital.

Every time someone mentions quantum computing, it's inevitably followed by phrases like:
- "Cure Cancer"
- "Solve Global Warming"
- "Quantum Supremacy" (the idea that quantum computers can outperform the fastest supercomputers thousands of times over)

**None of these claims seem to hold truth, and may never become reality.**

## The Verdict

It's too soon to completely count out quantum computing — there may be legitimate applications we haven't discovered yet. However, we seriously need to **temper our expectations** and acknowledge the harsh realities:

- Quantum computers won't replace classical computers
- General-purpose quantum computing is likely impossible due to fundamental physical constraints
- The promised breakthroughs have been "5-10 years away" for decades
- The hype far exceeds the reality

The quantum computing field needs less funding based on speculative promises and more honest conversations about actual achievable goals.
